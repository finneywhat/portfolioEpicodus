              <p class="text1"><span class="great">Background</span><br>
                B.S. Business Management, <span class="tech important">Virginia Tech</span> 2004<br>
                <br>
                I've worked in a variety of roles within the water utility industry since the summer of 2000. After five summers of installing water mains, fire hydrants, and water meters for the <span class="important">City of Fairfax (VA), Water Department</span>, I was hired full-time as a Laborer upon gradution from <span class="tech important">Virginia Tech</span>. Within two years, I was promoted to a construction administration position where I was responsible for reviewing site plan submissions, managing construction projects, and working with the department's consultants. In addtion, every day, I provided assistance to contractors, other departments, and customers in need of engineering assistance.<br>After nearly eight years working as a construction administrator, the city's water department was sold to <span class="important">Fairfax Water</span> - one of the country's largest water authorities. My initial role with <span class="important">Fairfax Water</span> was a construction technician, supporting the Construction Engineering Manager in a variety of capacities, from project managmement to field inspections. For the last year and a half of my time with <span class="important">Fairfax Water</span>, I worked as a planning technician within the Short Range Planning division reviewing site plan submissions and running computer models of the water system.<br>In January 2016, my wife and I sold our home and drove across the country on a journey of self-discovery. We settled in Portland, OR. I decided last year that I wanted to pursue a career as a developer and was intrigued by what <span class="important-1">Epicodus</span> had to offer.

              <br>
              I enjoy playing <span class="important">guitar</span>. While I may have purchased my first guitar over 15 years ago, I didn't start taking lessons until about two years ago.</p>
              <p class="text2">Over the last year, I've developed a relatively consistent <span class="important">yoga</span> practice. I greatly appreciate the physical improvements from the practice, but the mental gains are just as important.
              </p>
              <p class="text2">I've recently gotten into climbing while in Portland, and can foresee this becoming a passion. I enjoy the mental challenge that goes along with the obvious physical aspect of free-climbing a wall of holds.
              </p>
              <p class="text2">My skills include doodling, city driving, and lifting heavy objects.
